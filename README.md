String manipulation is a concept beneath NLP's general term, which refers to the process of changing or modifying strings, in order to manipulate 
data or text and reach the required format.




##### String-manipulation can be used to perform small actions like:

 - Rearranging white spaces
 - Positioning punctuation marks
 


##### String-manipulation also involve more complicated tasks like: 
- Removing duplicated words
- Correcting spelling and grammar rules
- Finding substrings & concatenating strings
 

<h3 align="center"> What we are trying to do here is  creating a command line interface <i>-Text Editor-</i> which also has the ability to perform some string manipulation techniques</h3>


## STRINGIFY Documentation
Stringify is a String manipulation program can 

Stringify program consist of main.asm file 

##### Notes: StringIFY program has an input data limitaion of  or we will face overflow excption so please ,don't try to use data size above the limitation

## Run Locally

1- Clone the project

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/MohamadSalamaMouse/Natural-Language-Processing.git
```

2- Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd Natural-Language-Processing
```

3- Then run the main.asm using any 8086 assembler.
#### Note: [Turbo Assembler](https://sourceforge.net/projects/guitasm8086/)  is preferred cause we built project using it.
