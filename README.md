# String-manipulation & Processing

 String manipulation is a concept beneath NLP's general term, which refers to the process of changing or modifying strings, in order to manipulate 
data or text and reach the required format.
 It can involve small actions like:
 - Rearranging white spaces
 - Deleting duplicated words
 - Replacing incorrect words
 
**What we are trying to do here is to create a command line text editor interface with the ability to perform some String manipulation techniques**
